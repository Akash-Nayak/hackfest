## Scenarios

For the crane project, we've defined several scenarios that demonstrate the value
for the tool, with ideally as litte as friction as possible to get started;
all you'll need to bring with you is a cluster (we recommend [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)),
and a `kubectl` tool.

Our scenario instructions can be found in our [documentation scenarios](#).
