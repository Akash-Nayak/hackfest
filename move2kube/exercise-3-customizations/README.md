# Learn how to write simple custom transformers for Move2Kube

Through this exercise, we will learn how we can customize the output of Move2Kube using custom tranformers.

We will learn how to-

1. [Customize the generated Dockerfile by overriding the built-in transformer](./exercise-3a-overriding-built-in-transformers/)

2. [Add custom annotations to the Kubernetes YAMLs using the Starlark-based transformer](./exercise-3b-starlark-based-transformers/)

3. [Create a container-based transformer](./exercise-3c-container-based-transformers/)

For more examples of custom transformers, you can check the [move2kube-transformers](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube-transformers) repository.
